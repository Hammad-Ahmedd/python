    "### 1. The Algorithms (The \"Brains\")\n",
    "These are the mathematical models we used to find patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm | Type | Description | Use When... |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Linear Regression** | Regression | Draws a **straight line** through data. | You want to predict a specific **Number** (Salary, Price). |\n",
    "| **Logistic Regression** | Classification | Uses probability (S-curve) to separate data. | You want to predict a **Category** (Yes/No, Spam/Ham). |\n",
    "| **Decision Tree** | Classification | Creates a **Flowchart** of If/Else rules. | You want a model that explains *why* it made a decision. |\n",
    "| **Random Forest** | Ensemble | Creates **100+ Trees** and makes them **Vote**. | You want high accuracy and to know **Feature Importance**. |\n",
    "| **K-Means** | Clustering | Finds **groups** based on distance. (No labels!) | You have data but **no answers** (Unsupervised). |\n",

    "### 2. The Concepts (The \"Workflow\")\n",
    "These are the steps you take in every project.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`X` (Features):** The input data (the questions). usually a Table (2D).\n",
    "*   **`y` (Target):** The output data (the answers). usually a List (1D).\n",
    "*   **`train_test_split`:**\n",
    "    *   *Concept:* Splitting data into **Training** (Textbook) and **Testing** (Exam).\n",
    "    *   *Why?* To prevent the model from memorizing the answers (\"Overfitting\").\n",
    "*   **`.fit(X, y)`:** The \"Study\" phase. The model learns the patterns.\n",
    "*   **`.predict(X)`:** The \"Test\" phase. The model guesses the answers for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evaluation Metrics (The \"Report Card\")\n",
    "How do we know if the model is good?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **For Regression (Numbers):**\n",
    "    *   **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** \"On average, the prediction is wrong by this amount.\" (Lower is better).\n",
    "*   **For Classification (Categories):**\n",
    "    *   **Accuracy Score:** The percentage of correct guesses (e.g., 0.80 = 80%).\n",
    "    *   **Confusion Matrix:** A grid showing exactly *where* the model made mistakes (e.g., How many times it confused a Cat for a Dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hyperparameters (The \"Settings\")\n",
    "These are the knobs **YOU** turn before training to change how the model learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`test_size`** (used in Split):\n",
    "    *   *Definition:* What % of data to save for the exam.\n",
    "    *   *Standard:* `0.2` (20%).\n",
    "*   **`random_state`** (used everywhere):\n",
    "    *   *Definition:* A \"seed\" number to make sure randomness is the **same** every time you run the code.\n",
    "    *   *Standard:* `42` (Just a tradition).\n",
    "*   **`max_depth`** (Decision Tree):\n",
    "    *   *Definition:* How many \"questions\" deep the tree can go.\n",
    "    *   *Why?* A small number (e.g., 2 or 3) keeps the model simple. A huge number makes it memorize (Overfit).\n",
    "*   **`n_estimators`** (Random Forest):\n",
    "    *   *Definition:* How many trees to build in the forest.\n",
    "    *   *Standard:* `100` (More is usually better, but slower).\n",
    "*   **`n_clusters`** (K-Means):\n",
    "    *   *Definition:* How many groups you want the computer to find.\n",
    "*   **`cv`** (Grid Search):\n",
    "    *   *Definition:* \"Cross Validation\". Splits the training data into smaller chunks (e.g., 5) to double-check the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Advanced Tools (The \"Pro\" Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`joblib`**:\n",
    "    *   *What:* Saves the trained model to a file (`.pkl`).\n",
    "    *   *Why:* So you can use the brain in a Website without training again.\n",
    "*   **`GridSearchCV`**:\n",
    "    *   *What:* Automatically tries every combination of hyperparameters (e.g., tries 10 trees, then 50, then 100).\n",
    "    *   *Why:* Finds the **best** model for you automatically.\n",
    "*   **`Pipeline`**:\n",
    "    *   *What:* A factory line that connects **Data Cleaning** -> **Model Training**.\n",
    "    *   *Why:* It prevents data leakage and simplifies code for production (Web Apps)."
