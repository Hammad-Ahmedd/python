    "### 1. The \"Browser\" Problem (Why you don't see anything)\n",
    "When you type `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict` into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, the browser **always sends a GET request**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Your code says: `@app.post(\"/predict\")`.\n",
    "*   Your browser sends: **GET** `/predict`.\n",
    "*   **The Result:** The API looks at its list and says, *\"I don't have a GET method for /predict, I only have a POST method.\"* It will usually show you an error like `{\"detail\": \"Method Not Allowed\"}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see your POST request work, you cannot just use the browser address bar. You must use a tool that can send \"Body\" data (like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or FastAPI's built-in **Swagger UI**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How the \"Big Four\" Methods Work\n",
    "Think of an API like a **Library System**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **GET (Read)**\n",
    "*   **What it does:** Asks the server for information. It doesn’t change anything on the server.\n",
    "*   **Analogy:** You ask the librarian, \"Can I see the details of the book 'Titanic'?\"\n",
    "*   **Why yours worked:** Your `home` function is a GET. When you go to `/`, the browser asks for info, and the server sends back the \"Titanic API is running\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **POST (Create / Send Data)**\n",
    "*   **What it does:** Sends data to the server to be processed or saved. This data is hidden inside the **\"Request Body.\"**\n",
    "*   **Analogy:** You fill out a form to register as a new library member and hand it to the librarian.\n",
    "*   **In your code:** Your `/predict` route needs information about a passenger (Age, Sex, Class, etc.). You can't fit all that info easily in a URL, so you send it as a JSON package in the \"Body.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PUT (Update)**\n",
    "*   **What it does:** Replaces or updates existing data.\n",
    "*   **Analogy:** You tell the librarian, \"I moved houses; please update my address in my profile.\"\n",
    "*   **In FastAPI:** `@app.put(\"/update-passenger/{id}\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DELETE (Remove)**\n",
    "*   **What it does:** Deletes data.\n",
    "*   **Analogy:** You tell the librarian, \"I want to cancel my membership. Delete my records.\"\n",
    "*   **In FastAPI:** `@app.delete(\"/delete-passenger/{id}\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How to see your POST result (The \"Docs\" trick)\n",
    "FastAPI has a built-in tool to test these methods without needing extra software.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Run your app.\n",
    "2.  Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser.\n",
    "3.  You will see your `/predict` route with a **green POST label**.\n",
    "4.  Click it, then click **\"Try it out\"**.\n",
    "5.  Enter the passenger data in the box provided.\n",
    "6.  Click **Execute**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now you will see the result:** `{\"status\":\"Alive\",\"Prediction\":1}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explaining your specific code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/predict\") # 1. We tell FastAPI this is a POST route\n",
    "def predict_status(passanger: Passanger): # 2. It expects a \"Body\" called passenger\n",
    "    data = pd.DataFrame([passanger.dict()]) # 3. It converts that body into a DataFrame\n",
    "    prediction = model.predict(data) # 4. The model processes the data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # 5. The server \"Returns\" the result to the person who sent the request\n",
    "    if result == 1:\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"Alive\", \"Prediction\": 1} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it doesn't \"stay\" on the screen:**\n",
    "When you \"Return\" something in an API, you are sending a response back to the sender (the client). If the sender is a Python script, it gets the JSON. If the sender is the Swagger UI, it displays the JSON. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary for your Learning:\n",
    "*   **GET** is for **fetching** (Browser friendly).\n",
    "*   **POST** is for **sending/calculating** (Needs a \"Body\").\n",
    "*   **PUT** is for **updating**.\n",
    "*   **DELETE** is for **removing**.\n",
    "*   **Always use `/docs`** to test your FastAPI work! It makes everything visible."
